# What is cryptocurrency?
A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake.

# Here’s a list of some of the cryptocurrencies:
## 1. Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created in 2009 by a person that goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. 

## 2. Ethereum

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a blockchain network, but Ethereum was designed as a programmable blockchain, meaning it wasn’t created to support a currency — but to enable the network’s users to create, publish, monetize, and use applications.

## 3. Cardano (ADA)

Cardano bills itself as a third-generation blockchain platform, to cast itself as a next-level player. Cardano relies on proof-of-stake (PoS), meaning that the complicated PoW calculations and high electricity usage required for mining coins like Bitcoin aren’t necessary, potentially making its network more efficient and sustainable.

## 4. Binance Coin (BNB)

Binance is one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, and Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency token that was created to be used as a medium of exchange on Binance. It was initially built on the Ethereum blockchain, but now lives on Binance’s own blockchain platform.

## 5. Tether

Tether was the first cryptocurrency marketed as a “stablecoin” — a breed of crypto known as fiat-collateralized stablecoins. The value of the tether is pegged to a fiat currency — in this case, the U.S. dollar.

## 6. Dogecoin

Dogecoin is widely known as the first joke cryptocurrency; it was launched in 2013 as a way to poke fun at Bitcoin. Nonetheless, the currency captured people’s attention and a fair amount of investment.

# About the Project
This Project is able to track the information about the 3 different types of bitcoin based on the parameters provided, like, start date, end date, type of crypto, data interval and value selector.

OHLCV is an aggregated form of market data standing for Open, High, Low, Close and Volume. OHLCV data includes 5 data points: the Open and Close represent the first and the last price level during a specified interval. High and Low represent the highest and lowest reached price during that interval. Volume is the total amount traded during that period. This data is most frequently represented in a candlestick chart, which allows traders to perform technical analysis on intraday values. We provide OHLCV data in granularities ranging from 1 second to 1 day. 

### Timestamp:Epoch timestamp in milliseconds

### Open: Opening price of the time interval in quote currency (For BTC/USD, the price would be USD).

### High:	Highest price reached during time interval, in quote currency.

### Low: Lowest price reached during time interval, in quote currency.

### Close:	Closing price of the time interval, in the quote currency. 

### Volume: Quantity of asset bought or sold, displayed in base currency.
